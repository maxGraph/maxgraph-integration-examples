# maxGraph integration examples

Demonstrate how to integrate [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/) in projects.

‚è© Find the live demo at https://maxgraph.github.io/maxgraph-integration-examples/

## Getting started

### Setup

Ensure you are using Node declared in the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file (this is the tested version, it may work with other versions without guarantee)

If you are using `nvm`, run
```shell
nvm use
```

If the Node version is not installed, `nvm` will state how to install the required version.

Install dependencies by running
```shell
npm install
```

Build the "shared" package:
- this package is used in all projects, so it must be built first.
- for more details, see its [dedicated README](projects/_shared/README.md).

**NOTE**: if you want to build all examples at once, you can run
```bash
./build-all-examples.bash
```

### Available projects

- [TypeScript with Farm](./projects/farm-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Lit](./projects/lit-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Parcel](./projects/parcel-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Rollup](./projects/rollup-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Rsbuild](./projects/rsbuild-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with SvelteKit](./projects/sveltekit-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with ViteJs](./projects/vitejs-ts/README.md)

### <a id="maxgraph-dev-version"></a> Use the maxGraph development version

**Note**: the `maxGraph` development version is tested in a [GitHub Workflow](./.github/workflows/check-typescript-projects.yml) that uses the procedure explained below.

Build [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/) locally:
  - from the `maxGraph` project root, run: `npm install`
  - then, from the `packages/core` folder, run: `npm pack`
  - the `packages/core` folder or the generated `packages/core/maxgraph-core-***.tgz` file are now ready for use in an external project

In this folder where you clone the `maxgraph-integration-examples` project, go to the folder of the example you want to use. Then you can use one of the following solution
  - with [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link): `npm link <path_to_locally_installed_maxgraph>/packages/core`: create a soft link to the maxgraph local folder.
  Repack of maxgraph is automatically available in the examples
  - alternative: `npm install <path_to_locally_installed_maxgraph>/packages/core/maxgraph-core-0.1.0.tgz`. This changes
  the package.json file. You must run this command again each time you rebuild the maxgraph npm package.


## Release

The versioning in this repository follow the versioning of `maxGraph`. For example, version _0.5.0_ uses `maxGraph` _0.5.0_.

So, prior releasing a new version of this version, the maxGraph version must have been updated:
  - Dependencies in this repository are automatically updated by Dependabot, so you can trigger a new Dependabot run or wait for the next scheduled Dependabot run for this update to take place.
  - Validate that the examples work: use the artifact built by GitHub Actions to test the various applications locally.

Once maxGraph has been updated, the release can be done by running the [release workflow](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxgraph-integration-examples/actions/workflows/release.yml) which:
  - creates the Git tag
  - publishes a GitHub release including the [automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes).
