Demonstrate how to integrate [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/) in projects.

‚è© Find the live demo at https://maxgraph.github.io/maxgraph-integration-examples/

## Getting started

### Setup

Ensure you are using Node 18 (this is the tested version, it may work with other versions without guarantee)

If you are using `nvm`, run
```shell
nvm use
```

If the Node version is not installed, `nvm` will state how to install the required version.

Install dependencies by running
```shell
npm install
```

### Available projects

- [TypeScript with Lit](./projects/lit-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Parcel](./projects/parcel-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with Rollup](./projects/rollup-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with SvelteKit](./projects/sveltekit-ts/README.md)
- [TypeScript with ViteJs](./projects/vitejs-ts/README.md)

### <a id="maxgraph-dev-version"></a> Use the maxGraph development version

**Note**: the `maxGraph` development version is tested in a [GitHub Workflow](./.github/workflows/check-typescript-projects.yml) that uses the procedure explained below.

Build [maxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph/) locally:
  - from the `maxGraph` project root, run: `npm install`
  - then, from the `packages/core` folder, run: `npm pack`
  - the `packages/core` folder or the generated `packages/core/maxgraph-core-***.tgz` file are now ready for use in an external project

In this folder where you clone the `maxgraph-integration-examples` project, go to the folder of the example you want to use. Then you can use one of the following solution
  - with [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link): `npm link <path_to_locally_installed_maxgraph>/packages/core`: create a soft link to the maxgraph local folder.
  Repack of maxgraph is automatically available in the examples
  - alternative: `npm install <path_to_locally_installed_maxgraph>/packages/core/maxgraph-core-0.1.0.tgz`. This changes
  the package.json file. You must run this command again each time you rebuild the maxgraph npm package.
